Using pythagorean calculation for expected winning percentage values (pyth) from http://www.kenpom.com and each team's seeds, bracket-maker will generate a (somewhat) random NCAA March Madness bracket.

The expected input is the filename of a csv file containing the teams, their pyth values, and their seeds sorted by region. 

--[REGION NAME 1]--
[seed]|[team name]|[pyth]
[seed]|[team name]|[pyth]
[seed]|[team name]|[pyth]
...
--[REGION NAME 2]--
[seed]|[team name]|[pyth]
[seed]|[team name]|[pyth]
[seed]|[team name]|[pyth]
...


Each region is expected to have 16 teams, where the winners of Region 1 and 2 play each other in round 5 (and teams from Region 3 and 4 play)

The formula for calculating a team's adjusted seed is as follows:
	
	adjustedSeed = 16/seed * (pyth^2)

To determine a winner between two teams, the follow algorithm is executed:

	seed_total = team1.adjustedSeed + team2.adjustedSeed
	r = random(0, seed_total)
	
	if (r < team1.adjustedSeed) team1 wins
	else team2 wins
